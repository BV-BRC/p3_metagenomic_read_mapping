# p3_metagenomic_read_mapping_service

This update to the Metagenomic Read Mapping service will allow users to compare their input reads to a their own BV-BRC feature group, input fasta file and updated predefined gene sets, the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) and the [Virulence Factor Database (VFDB)](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/).  These updates add support for users with viral data rather than soley bacterial.  See the README.md in the service directory for details about updating the predefined gene sets. See the tests directory for examples outlined via parameter .JSON files.
