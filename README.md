# Metagenomic Read Mapping

## Overview

The Metagenomic Read Mapping Service uses [KMA](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2336-6) to align reads against antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, or other custom sets of genes.

## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).

There is one application service specification defined here:
1.  [MetagenomicReadMapping](app_specs/MetagenomicReadMapping.md): Service that that provides the backend for the BV-BRC web inerface; it takes reads as input.

The code in this module provides the BV-BRC application service wrapper scripts for the Metagenomic Read Mapping service as well
as some backend utilities:

| Script name | Purpose |
